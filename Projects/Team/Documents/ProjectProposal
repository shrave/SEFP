Our project proposals are:-
1.)To make a voice based code editor where generic codes, functions and procedures get written by mere calling of the funcion.For example, when we say "Take 5 integers as an input".The editor will directly write code to input 5 integers.
If we say "Apply insertion sort". A method for insertion sort will directly be called.
2.) A customized browser for differently abled users of the internet. The browser will first test the abilities of the user through various tests and then based on his/her capabilities, enable and disable plugins/tools that will help the user navigate the internet. The types of disabilities are inspired from https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/people-use-web/stories .
