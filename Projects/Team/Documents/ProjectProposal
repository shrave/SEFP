Our project proposals are:-
1.)To make a voice based code editor where generic codes, functions and procedures get written by mere calling of the funcion.For example, when we say "Take 5 integers as an input".The editor will directly write code to input 5 integers.
If we say "Apply insertion sort". A method for insertion sort will directly be called.
