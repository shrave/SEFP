What you learnt outside the class?
Be specific...

Week1

I looked around websites to see the various projects in the websites.
I learnt to trust myself and understand that I too can handle projects and finish coding big projects.It is only the initial phase that has to overcomed.

Week 5
It is very important to push ourselves and aim for the best. We often aim for the mediocre which keeps us where we are. We must aim for higher and try to improve ourselves each time. Each one of us is capable of achieving what we want. We just need to have the right motivation and inspiration.
Good conferences have quality and appreciation/reviews from their panel on our work certifies our work.
